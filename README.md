# PythonChallengeSolutions
Here are My Solutions to Python Challenge. Python Challenge (URL:www.pythonchallenge.com/) is an online programming game written by Nadav Samet，in which each level can be solved by a bit of programming. Despite the name，most riddles can be solved in any programming language. As a Python-learner，i find it fun to learn Python，as well as to refresh and broaden my knowledge of programming in such a way. My solutions are written in Python. There is also a related article in Chinese in my blog，whose url is https://blog.csdn.net/denalmighty/article/details/80022034.
Well，this repository serves as my hands-on lesson of GitHub. Wish I could find some fun here:)
